This is a PHP library for reading information from a variety of chip music file formats.  It also handles tag management.

To utilize this amazing fiasco ---

<?php

include('chiptag.php');

$chiptune = chiptag::open($chiptune_filename);

// chiptag guesses the format from the file's extension
// chiptag then creates an object from the appropriate class

$chiptune->FetchInfo(); // loads tags and other info

$chiptune->SetTag($tag_name,$value); // duh?

$chiptune->WriteTags(); // commit set tags to the file

echo $chiptune->ReadableReport(); // view history log

?>


Look inside the formats folder for info and examples on
adding more chiptune formats to this library.
